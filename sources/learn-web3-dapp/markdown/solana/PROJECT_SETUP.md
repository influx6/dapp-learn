# üíª Requirements

You will need to [install the Solana CLI](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools) to complete this Pathway.

## üêë Local clone

If you cloned the `learn-web3-dapp` repo locally, pay attention to the following:

{% hint style="tip" %}
**Windows Users:** There are known compatibility issues with the Solana BPF toolchain. You will need to use the Windows Subsystem for Linux to compile Solana programs. Please refer to the [installation guide](https://docs.figment.io/network-documentation/extra-guides/solana-setup-for-windows) we have provided.\
**macOS Users:** If you are using any Apple Silicon products (M1 processor), you may need to build the Solana CLI from source. [Refer to this article for more information](https://dev.to/codenjobs/how-to-make-solana-test-validator-work-with-a-macbook-with-m1-chip-5emd).
{% endhint %}

# üß© API keys

**DataHub has discontinued Free accounts**. All Figment Learn pathways now make use of public RPC endpoints only. There is no need to supply an API key to access the public endpoints for Solana.

If you're using a private infractructure provider, you may require an API key to access nodes via their endpoints. Remember to have your API key saved in `/learn-web3-dapp/.env.local`. You can then reference your API key in the pathway code via `process.env.<SOME_VARIABLE_NAME>`.

If you are using the [Solana default public endpoints](https://docs.solana.com/cluster/rpc-endpoints) you do not require an API key, and you can connect directly without any additions to `.env.local`.

{% hint style="tip" %}
If the Next.js development server was running at the time you changed the environment variable's value, you will need to restart the Next.js server to make it aware of the new value. You can do this by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the Next.js server is running, then restart it with the command `yarn dev`.
{% endhint %}

# ü§ñ Using a Test Validator

At some point it may be necessary to run a Test Validator. For example, if you can't get airdrops because the Devnet faucet is not working. To run a local Test Validator you will need to have the Solana CLI installed. Use this command in its own terminal tab or window :

```text
solana-test-validator
```

Use `solana config set` to target a particular cluster. After setting a cluster target, any future subcommands will send/receive information from that cluster. To target a running Test Validator with the Solana CLI :

```text
solana config set --url http://localhost:8899
```

You can see which cluster the Solana command-line tool (CLI) is currently targeting and the paths to your keypair and configuration file with the command :

```text
solana config get
```

# üîê Keypair storage

During the "Create an account" step, you will need to generate a keypair for use in the tutorials (by completing the code challenge). This keypair is kept in the localstorage of your web browser, and is distinct from any keypairs generated by the Solana CLI. After the keypair is generated, it will remain visible (and copyable) at the top of the screen.
